   - Mock on-chain evidence (CID, TX hash, chain ID)
   - Odds chart (mock data)
   - Stake panel

4. **Stake Logic** (15s)
   - Show enabled stake button
   - Show disabled state (cutoff passed)

## Demo 2: Linera Integration Evidence (Alternative)

### Purpose
Prove Linera SDK integration through code and architecture

### Recommended Approach

**Windows Users**: Mock Mode + Code Evidence (fastest, fully valid)
```powershell
# 1. Mock demo
.\scripts\start-mock.ps1

# 2. Show Linera evidence
.\scripts\show-linera-evidence.ps1

# Check logs
Get-Content docs\screens\build-and-tests.log
```

**WSL2/Linux Users**: Full Linera Devnet (real APP_IDs)
```bash
# Install Linera CLI
cargo install linera-service

# Validate setup
./scripts/dev-check.sh

# Deploy to devnet
./scripts/deploy-local.sh

# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm start
```

**See `docs/LINERA_WINDOWS_WORKAROUND.md` for Windows CLI installation options.**

### Steps
1. **StatusBar** (10s)
   - Show Linera service URL
   - Block height (real)
   - Latency (real)
   - Status indicator (green)

2. **Events with On-Chain Evidence** (20s)
   - Navigate to Events
   - Click event
   - Show **real** on-chain evidence:
     - âœ… IPFS CID (clickable, opens gateway)
     - âœ… TX Hash (copyable)
     - âœ… Chain ID (from Linera)
     - âœ… Confidence % (from oracle)
     - âœ… Sources (verification links)

3. **Real-Time Odds Polling** (15s)
   - Show odds chart
   - Explain 3s polling interval
   - Show odds update (if stake happens)

4. **Stake with Anti-Manipulation** (20s)
   - Enter stake amount
   - Show potential payout
   - Click "Place Prediction"
   - Show velocity cap warning (if triggered)
   - Show cooldown message (if triggered)
   - Show auto-disabled when cutoff passed

5. **GraphQL Query** (15s)
   - Open browser DevTools Network tab
   - Show GraphQL request to Linera service
   - Show response with market data

### Evidence Required
- âœ… TX hash visible and copyable
- âœ… Chain ID displayed
- âœ… IPFS CID link works
- âœ… Odds polling (3s interval)
- âœ… Stake button logic (enabled/disabled)
- âœ… GraphQL request in Network tab

### Key Proof Points
1. **Uses Linera SDK**: WASM contracts deployed
2. **On-chain data**: TX hash, chain ID, CID
3. **Real-time**: GraphQL polling every 3s
4. **Anti-manipulation**: Velocity cap, cooldown
5. **Microchains**: Isolated state per event

## Recording Tips

### Setup
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Browser zoom: 100%
- Clear browser cache before recording
- Close unnecessary tabs

### Tools
- Windows: OBS Studio, ShareX, Game Bar (Win+G)
- Screen recording: 30fps minimum
- Audio: Optional narration

### Narration Script (Optional)

**Mock Mode:**
> "Verisight: AI-verified prediction markets. Events are verified by AI agents with confidence scores. Users can stake on outcomes with real-time odds."

**Linera Mode:**
> "Every event is published on-chain using Linera microchains. Here's the proof: IPFS CID for full data, transaction hash for immutability, and chain ID. Odds update in real-time via GraphQL. Anti-manipulation guards prevent price manipulation."
