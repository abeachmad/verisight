# ðŸŽ¬ Demo Plan

## Demo 1: Mock Mode (30-60s)

### Purpose
Show UI/UX flow without blockchain dependency

### Steps
1. **Landing Page** (5s)
   - Show hero section
   - Navigate to Events

2. **Events List** (10s)
   - Show AI-verified events
   - Confidence badges (95%, 87%, etc.)
   - Click event to detail

3. **Market Detail** (20s)
   - Event info with confidence bar
   - Mock on-chain evidence (CID, TX hash, chain ID)
   - Odds chart (mock data)
   - Stake panel

4. **Stake Logic** (15s)
   - Show enabled stake button
   - Show disabled state (cutoff passed)
   - Show disabled state (resolved)

5. **Dashboard** (10s)
   - StatusBar metrics
   - Analytics overview

### Evidence

## Demo 2: Linera Mode (60-90s)

### Purpose
Prove Linera SDK integration with on-chain evidence

### Prerequisites
- Devnet running
- Apps deployed (oracle_feed + market)
- Frontend in LINERA mode

### Steps
1. **StatusBar** (10s)
   - Show Linera service URL
   - Block height (real)
   - Latency (real)
   - Status indicator (green)

2. **Events with On-Chain Evidence** (20s)
   - Navigate to Events
   - Click event
   - Show **real** on-chain evidence:
     - âœ… IPFS CID (clickable, opens gateway)
     - âœ… TX Hash (copyable)
     - âœ… Chain ID (from Linera)
     - âœ… Confidence % (from oracle)
     - âœ… Sources (verification links)

3. **Real-Time Odds Polling** (15s)
   - Show odds chart
   - Explain 3s polling interval
   - Show odds update (if stake happens)

4. **Stake with Anti-Manipulation** (20s)
   - Enter stake amount
   - Show potential payout
   - Click "Place Prediction"
   - Show velocity cap warning (if triggered)
   - Show cooldown message (if triggered)
   - Show auto-disabled when cutoff passed

5. **GraphQL Query** (15s)
   - Open browser DevTools Network tab
   - Show GraphQL request to Linera service
   - Show response with market data

### Evidence Required
- âœ… TX hash visible and copyable
- âœ… Chain ID displayed
- âœ… IPFS CID link works
- âœ… Odds polling (3s interval)
- âœ… Stake button logic (enabled/disabled)
- âœ… GraphQL request in Network tab

### Key Proof Points
1. **Uses Linera SDK**: WASM contracts deployed
2. **On-chain data**: TX hash, chain ID, CID
3. **Real-time**: GraphQL polling every 3s
4. **Anti-manipulation**: Velocity cap, cooldown
5. **Microchains**: Isolated state per event

## Recording Tips

### Setup
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Browser zoom: 100%
- Clear browser cache before recording
- Close unnecessary tabs

### Tools
- Windows: OBS Studio, ShareX, Game Bar (Win+G)
- Screen recording: 30fps minimum
- Audio: Optional narration

### Narration Script (Optional)

**Mock Mode:**
> "Verisight: AI-verified prediction markets. Events are verified by AI agents with confidence scores. Users can stake on outcomes with real-time odds."

**Linera Mode:**
> "Every event is published on-chain using Linera microchains. Here's the proof: IPFS CID for full data, transaction hash for immutability, and chain ID. Odds update in real-time via GraphQL. Anti-manipulation guards prevent price manipulation."
