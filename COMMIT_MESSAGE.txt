docs+scripts: strengthen Linera evidence; add WSL2 workaround and judges checklist; add .sh scripts

## Changes

### Documentation
- Added `docs/JUDGES-CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive submission guide for buildathon judges
  * Mock mode demo steps with screenshots checklist
  * Code evidence requirements (WASM builds, tests, deployment scripts)
  * Linera SDK usage proof points
  * Quick start commands for judges (5 min evaluation)
  
- Added `docs/LINERA_WINDOWS_WORKAROUND.md` - Windows CLI installation guide
  * Problem explanation (libclang dependency)
  * WSL2 installation steps (recommended)
  * LLVM/Clang alternative
  * Buildathon submission strategy (Mock + Code Evidence)
  
- Updated `README.md`
  * Added "Dual-Mode Strategy" section upfront
  * Added "Quick Links" section for judges
  * Clear explanation of Mock vs Linera modes
  
- Updated `DEMO_PLAN.md`
  * Simplified recommendations (Windows vs WSL2)
  * Added reference to JUDGES-CHECKLIST.md
  * Clearer timeline estimates

### Scripts

#### PowerShell (Windows)
- Improved `scripts/show-linera-evidence.ps1`
  * Comprehensive logging to `docs/screens/build-and-tests.log`
  * WASM file size reporting
  * Deployment command extraction
  * Fixed path handling with absolute paths
  * ASCII markers instead of Unicode for compatibility
  
#### Bash (WSL2/Linux)
- Added `scripts/dev-check.sh` - Full validation (fmt/clippy/test/WASM/frontend)
- Added `scripts/deploy-local.sh` - Real devnet deployment with APP_ID extraction
- Added `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` - Testnet connection with GraphQL probe

All .sh scripts mirror .ps1 functionality for cross-platform support.

### Evidence Generation

Running `.\scripts\show-linera-evidence.ps1` now produces:
- ✅ WASM builds for oracle_feed + market
- ✅ All Rust tests passing
- ✅ WASM file sizes
- ✅ Deployment commands (linera publish)
- ✅ WSL2 script availability check
- ✅ Complete log file in docs/screens/

## Buildathon Submission Strategy

**Primary (Windows)**: Mock Mode + Code Evidence
- Time: 10 minutes total
- Evidence: Working app + WASM contracts + tests + scripts
- Valid: Demonstrates Linera SDK usage without CLI dependency

**Optional (WSL2/Linux)**: Real Devnet Deployment
- Time: +60-90 minutes (including WSL2 setup)
- Evidence: Real APP_IDs, chain ID, live GraphQL
- Stronger: Actual on-chain deployment proof

## Testing

All existing functionality preserved:
- ✅ Mock mode works (start-mock.ps1)
- ✅ WASM builds successful
- ✅ All Rust tests passing (oracle_feed + market)
- ✅ Backend tests passing (29 tests)
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully

## For Judges

Quick evaluation (5 minutes):
```powershell
git clone <repo>
cd verisight
.\scripts\start-mock.ps1          # See working app
.\scripts\show-linera-evidence.ps1 # See Linera integration
Get-Content docs\screens\build-and-tests.log
```

See `docs/JUDGES-CHECKLIST.md` for complete evaluation guide.
