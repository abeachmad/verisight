# Mock Mode Fix Summary

## Changes Applied

### 1. Environment Variables (start-mock.ps1)
✅ Set `REACT_APP_MODE=MOCK`
✅ Set `REACT_APP_DEMO_DATA=true`  
✅ Set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001`
✅ Echo all env vars to console for verification

### 2. MSW Pre-Render Initialization (index.js)
✅ Converted to async bootstrap
✅ MSW starts BEFORE React renders
✅ Unregisters old service workers automatically
✅ Waits for worker.start() to complete

### 3. Handler URL Patterns (handlers.js)
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/api/events`, `**/events`
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/api/markets`, `**/markets`
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/api/markets/:id`, `**/markets/:id`
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/api/odds/:market_id`, `**/odds/:market_id`
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/evidence/:id`
✅ Added wildcard patterns `**/health`, `**/api/health`, `/health`

**Intercepted Endpoints:**
- `**/api/events` → 10 events
- `**/events` → 10 events
- `**/api/markets` → 10 markets
- `**/markets` → 10 markets
- `**/api/markets/:id` → market detail with odds + evidence
- `**/markets/:id` → market detail with odds + evidence
- `**/health` → block height + latency simulation

### 4. Hard Fallback (Events.jsx)
✅ Import eventsFixture directly
✅ Initialize state with fixtures if MOCK mode
✅ Fallback to fixtures if fetch fails
✅ Immediate render without waiting for network

### 5. Hard Fallback (MarketDetail.jsx)
✅ Import marketsFixture, oddsFixture, evidenceFixture, eventsFixture
✅ Load from fixtures if MOCK mode
✅ Combine market + event + odds + evidence
✅ Apply jitter to odds for realism
✅ Fallback to fixtures if fetch fails

### 6. StatusBar Enhancement
✅ Show "MOCK DATA" badge (purple) when in MOCK mode
✅ Show "(Mock Mode)" text next to metrics
✅ Health status displays even if unknown

### 7. Service Worker Hygiene
✅ Unregister all old service workers on bootstrap
✅ Fresh MSW worker on every start
✅ No cache conflicts

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Frontend compiled successfully
✅ No errors or warnings

### Services Started
✅ Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8001
✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000
✅ Environment variables set correctly

## Expected Results

### Events Page (http://localhost:3000/events)
- ✅ Shows 10 events immediately
- ✅ Category filters: All, Politics, Crypto, Sports, Science, Tech, Entertainment
- ✅ Confidence badges: 91%, 87%, 73%, 82%, 65%, 78%, 69%, 85%, 92%, 42%
- ✅ Status badges: verified, verifying, pending
- ✅ No "No events found" message

### Market Detail (http://localhost:3000/markets/mkt_001)
- ✅ Shows market title
- ✅ Confidence bar with percentage
- ✅ On-chain evidence section:
  - IPFS CID (clickable)
  - TX Hash (copyable)
  - Chain ID
  - Block Height
  - Sources (clickable links)
- ✅ Current odds (Yes/No percentages)
- ✅ Stake button (enabled/disabled based on cutoff/resolved)
- ✅ "mock" label on evidence section

### StatusBar
- ✅ "MOCK DATA" badge (purple)
- ✅ Status indicator
- ✅ Block height (incrementing every 5s)
- ✅ Latency (80-180ms)
- ✅ "(Mock Mode)" text

## DevTools Verification

Open DevTools → Network tab:
1. Filter by "events" → Should see request with status 200 "from ServiceWorker"
2. Filter by "markets" → Should see request with status 200 "from ServiceWorker"
3. Filter by "health" → Should see request with status 200 "from ServiceWorker"

## Screenshot Selectors

For demo recording:
- Events list: `.container .grid > a` (10 items)
- Confidence badges: `span.px-3.py-1.rounded` (colored badges)
- Market detail: `.bg-gray-900.rounded-lg` (evidence section)
- IPFS CID: `a[href^="https://ipfs.io"]`
- TX Hash: `span.font-mono.text-xs`
- StatusBar: `.bg-gray-900.text-white` (top bar)
- MOCK badge: `span.bg-purple-600` ("MOCK DATA")

## Troubleshooting

If data still doesn't show:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear cache: DevTools → Application → Clear storage
3. Check console for "[MSW] Mock Service Worker started"
4. Check Network tab for "from ServiceWorker" status
5. Verify .env.local has REACT_APP_MODE=MOCK

## Commit Message

```
chore(mock): force MSW init pre-render, catch all API masks, add hard fixtures fallback, and SW hygiene

- Convert index.js to async bootstrap with MSW pre-render
- Add wildcard patterns (**/api/*, **/events, etc.) to handlers
- Import fixtures directly in Events and MarketDetail for immediate render
- Unregister old service workers automatically
- Update StatusBar to show "MOCK DATA" badge
- Set REACT_APP_MODE=MOCK in start-mock.ps1
- Frontend builds successfully with all fixes
```
